# Multi_Banked_Cachce_Modelling
This repository contains a C implementation of a multi-banked cache model. The model represents a commonly used cache architecture found in various systems such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and other high-performance computing devices. The implementation aims to provide a flexible and efficient representation of a multi-banked cache.
